THE KEY TOPICS I TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION FOR CREATING THIS DASHBOARD
Building Dashboard for year 2021 and 2022.
Primary KPI:- Total Casualties and total Accident values for current year(CY) and YoY growth.
              Total Casualties by accident severity for current year(CY) and YoY growth.
Secondary KPI:-Total casualties with respect to vehicle type for current year.   
               Monthly trend showing comparision of casualties for current year and previous year(PY).
Casualties by road type for current year
Current year casualties by area/location and by day/night
Total casualties and total accidents by location    


RESULTS:
Total CY Casualties i,e (2022): 195.7K reduced by -11.9% comparing to PY Casualties.
Total CY Accidents i,e (2022): 144.4K reduced by -11.7% comparing to PY Accidents.
Total CY Fatal Casualties i,e (2022): 2.9K reduced by -33.3% comparing to PY Fatal Casualties.
Total CY Slight Casualties i,e (2022): 165.8K reduced by -10.6% comparing to PY Slight Casualtiees.

The Road Accident mostly occurs in Vehicle Type:- CAR (155.8k Accidents), comparing to other vehicle type
Accidents mostly occur in Urban area which sum up to 61.95% and rural taking 38.05% in CY.
It is also seen that Accidents or casualties happens mostly during Daylight (73.84%) and Night/dark (26.16%).


The authorities may also focus mostly on how to improve Single Carriageway Road Type since it is the hotspot of casualties or accidents taking the numbers upto 145K. 

In conclusion, we can see that the accidents is getting reduced in 2022 comparing to 2021. However, in addition, November tends to be the most occured accidents months in bth the years.
